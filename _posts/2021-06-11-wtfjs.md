# WTFJS?

There's a lot of interesting content in [WTFJS](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs/blob/master/README.md). It is a project that started with a keynote presented by Brian Leroux in 2012, collecting a list of bizarre aspects of JS. These mostly consist of non-intuitive results due to implicit operations like JS's automatic type conversion. Most examples make you wonder if such things could actually happen, but many are indeed plausible scenarios.

For instance, there are issues caused by `parseInt`.

# parseInt
```javascript
parseInt("fck"); // -> NaN parseInt("fck", 16); // -> 15
```
> 💡 Explanation: This occurs because `parseInt` continues to parse the string character by character until it reaches an unknown character. In 'f*ck', f represents 15 in hexadecimal.
```javascript
parseInt(null, 24); // -> 23
```

> 💡 Explanation:
> Trying to convert `null` to the string "null". Since there are no numbers to convert for bases 0 to 23, it returns NaN. At base 24, "n", the 14th letter, gets added to the numeral system. By 31, "u", the 21st letter is included, allowing the entire string to be decoded. At 37, there are no more valid sets of numbers to generate, thus returning NaN.

```javascript
parseInt(0.000001); // -> 0 parseInt(0.0000001); // -> 1 parseInt(1 / 1999999); // -> 5
```


> 💡 Explanation: `parseInt` takes a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix. `parseInt` also strips everything in the string parameter that is not the first non-digit, including numbers. 0.000001 turns into the string "0.000001", and `parseInt` returns 0. 0.0000001 transforms into the string "1e-7", so `parseInt` returns 1. 1/1999999 is interpreted as 5.00000250000125e-7, and `parseInt` returns 5.

# Summary

In summary, `parseInt` behaves as follows:
- It applies `toString` to every input. *Even to Numbers!*
- If there is nothing to parse, it throws an error. However, if there's something to parse, it parses as much as it can and pretends everything's normal, always parsing from the beginning.
- If the radix is not specified, and if ES5 is supported, it defaults to decimal 10, but if not supported, it processes based on the input string.

Thus, when using `parseInt`, it's best to follow these guidelines:
- Verify that the input is actually a string.
- Always specify the radix.
- Make sure the string consists only of characters valid for the radix you're parsing (consider using regular expressions for validation).
